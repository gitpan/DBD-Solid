There are some performance values I checked for the DBD::Solid
interface.

Please note that this values are *NO* offical SOLID benchmarks; they 
were produced by running some scripts I used to check the DBD::Solid 
interface. See bench/* and mytest/* for details.

In real live I build Oracle based access control and time attendance
systems for a small Austrian company. Using DBD::Oracle, it was easy
to convert some tables out of a customer's data base to get LOTS of
real-world data for testing.

Software:
	DBD::Solid v0.03
	DBI 0.73
	Linux 2.0.28
	Solid server 2.1, test drive, default installation,
      		no special performance tricks.
Hardware: 
	486/100, Linux 2.0.28, 32 MB Ram, SCSI HD

Inserts are done with AutoCommit OFF.

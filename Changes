Revision history for Perl extension DBD::Solid.

0.07   Sun Jun 08 20:14:01 MET DST 1997
    Bugfixes:
	* bind_columns now works immediate after prepare().
	* AutoCommit handled by driver,
	  rollback/commit at disconnect() depends on AutoCommit value.
	  This works around a Solid database bug.
          
    Enhancements:
	* The write/only attribute $dbh->{solid_characterset} may be
	  used to activate Solid's character set translation features.
	* Makefile.PL knows about more operating systems:
		linux SCO3.2 hpux irix solaris
	* changed function names so DBD::Oracle and DBD::Solid may
	  coexist in a static perl binary
	* $dbh->{AutoCommit} is now ON by default (to comply 
	  to DBI spec)
        * links dynamic by default
        * $sth->execute() returns the row count [the same value
          like $h->rows(), so returns -1 after executing a select]
        * $sth->rows() counts the rows actually fetched from the
          database.
    INCOMPATIBILITIES:
	* It's not longer possible to set the size of the buffer 
	  used to fetch LONG columns using the $sth->{blob_size} syntax.
	  You may use either the solid_blob_size attribute to prepare()
	  or the blob_read function.
	* After fetching all rows, $sth->err becomes zero instead 
	  of +100 to suppress weird messages from $h->{PrintError} 
	  at end of each fetch.

	* Bugfix for perl 5.003: testenv.pm now uses Exporter.

0.05   Sat May 10 03:24:12 MET DST 1997
	* truncate of LONG fields is now working
	* some minor bugs, especially tests, are fixed
	* error handling complies to the DBI draft
	  ($h->err, $h->errstr and $h->state should be full functional)
	* Makefile.PL is now a bit more intelligent
	* Tested with Perl5.003_95 and DBI-0.81

0.04   
	- The 0.03 test problem is FIXED.
       	- Bugfix fetchrow(): returns truncated LONG VARCHAR columns now 
       		with the truncated size, not padded with random 
		memory contents.
       	- Bugfix fetchrow(): TIMESTAMP values are now converted to 
       		ascii without forgetting the time value. This is
		done using sprintf(). 
		No way with implicit TIMESTAMP=>C_CHAR conversion (???)
       	- Makefile.PL: 
       		added Solid-2.2 filenames.
		added [experimental] shared linking with static
			Solid libraries.
       	- blob_read() works! - at least with Solid-2.2.

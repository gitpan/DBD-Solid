Revision history for Perl extension DBD::Solid.

0.05   Sat May 10 03:24:12 MET DST 1997
	* truncate of LONG fields is now working
	* some minor bugs, especially tests, are fixed
	* error handling complies to the DBI draft
	  ($h->err, $h->errstr and $h->state should be full functional)
	* Makefile.PL is now a bit more intelligent
	* Tested with Perl5.003_95 and DBI-0.81

0.04   
	- The 0.03 test problem is FIXED.
       	- Bugfix fetchrow(): returns truncated LONG VARCHAR columns now 
       		with the truncated size, not padded with random 
		memory contents.
       	- Bugfix fetchrow(): TIMESTAMP values are now converted to 
       		ascii without forgetting the time value. This is
		done using sprintf(). 
		No way with implicit TIMESTAMP=>C_CHAR conversion (???)
       	- Makefile.PL: 
       		added Solid-2.2 filenames.
		added [experimental] shared linking with static
			Solid libraries.
       	- blob_read() works! - at least with Solid-2.2.

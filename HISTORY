970320 - v0.04 released.
970319 - site_perl/xxxx/auto/DBD/Solid *MUST* be cleared
	 before building static after a dynamic build !!
	 (version problem with constant modules).
970317 - Makefile.PL now makes more sense when more than one 
	 Solid lib is found.
970316 - Argh! what's the way to return $dbh->state ???
970314 - checking some attributes.
       - The 0.03 test problem is FIXED.
       - Bugfix fetchrow(): returns truncated LONG VARCHAR columns now 
       		with the truncated size, not padded with random 
		memory contents.
       - Bugfix fetchrow(): TIMESTAMP values are now converted to 
       		ascii without forgetting the time value. This is
		done using sprintf(). 
		No way with implicit TIMESTAMP=>C_CHAR conversion (???)
       - Makefile.PL: 
       		added Solid-2.2 filenames.
		added [experimental] shared linking with static
			Solid libraries.
       - blob_read() works! - at least with Solid-2.2.
970306 installed DBI-0.77.
       t04long runs without problems (???).
970305 installed libc-5.4.23 to analyze memory problems.
       Fine. t/03dbatt and t/04long fails like for anybody else.
970303 released v0.03
970301 Doing some tests with real-world data.
    * Bugfixes:
        Parameter binding: 	
	  - Date/Time parameters need SqlType=VARCHAR.
	  - NULL parameters.
	Column binding:
	  - need to allocate DisplaySize + 1 bytes (sic!)
    *   $sth->{cursorname}
	- became $sth->{CursorName} and is now read-only. 
	  Cursorname is set to 'DBD_CURSOR_nnnn'.
970226  released 0.02
970214	started work for v0.02.
    * added sth attribute $sth->{blob_size}, controlling
    	the max size of a LONG type fetched from the database.
    * added attribs to prepare():
	$attribs = {
	    cursorname  => 'foobar',
	    blob_size   => 4096
	    }
    * added STORE and FETCH functions to db and st functions.
      now we can set:	   	Parameter
				Output
	$dbh->{AutoCommit}	$	0 = off, 1 = on
	$sth->{cursorname}	$	immediate after prepare()
	$sth->{blob_size}	$	number
      and retrieve:
	$dbh->{AutoCommit} 	$  	true = on, false = off
	$sth->{cursorname}	$	must be set before
	$sth->{blob_size}	$	number
	$sth->{NUM_OF_PARAMS}	$
	$sth->{NUM_OF_FIELDS}  	$
	$sth->{NAME}   		\@ Column names         
	$sth->{TYPE}   		\@ Column data types as strings (SPEC ?)
	$sth->{NULLABLE}  	\@      
	$sth->{PRECISIION}  	\@
	$sth->{SCALE} 		\@
	$sth->{sol_type} 	\@ Column data types (numbers) (SPEC ?)
	$sth->{sol_length}	\@ Column length
970105	released version 0.01.
	missing support for:
		* LONG datatypes
		* cursor names for CURRENT OF updates
		* $dbh->{} objects
		* $sth->{} objects

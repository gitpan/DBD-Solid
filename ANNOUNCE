Friends, 

I just uploaded DBD::Solid 0.11 to CPAN. 

DBD::Solid is a driver code that enables Perl 5.003 and 5.004
to access the Solid RDBMS via the DBI module (you will need
the code for the latest release of DBI and DBD::Solid).

Tim Bunce's DBI module is *the* standard way to access a number of 
different databases from perl.

SOLID is one of the few SQL/ODBC databases engines available for 
Linux and for other UNIX and non-UNIX platforms.

This version fixes some bugs and DBI compliance problems:
    IMPORTANT fix: 
    	* rebinding of placeholders and NULL values
    Minor fixes:
        * $sth->err gets Solid's native error code. 
       	  Recent versions used to set $xxx->err to -1 independent 
	  of the error returned by Solid.
	* SELECT statements not longer require a finish() between 
	  execute() of the same sth.
        * All binary columns (including BINARY and VARBINARY
	  types) may be used from perl in a transparent fashion.
        * ping() not raising error even if RaiseError is set.
        * DBD::Solid::Const not longer used inside Solid.pm 
	  due to problems with mod_perl/embperl. SQL type values 
	  are included in recent DBI modules.
	* tests use now DBI_DSN/DBI_USER/DBI_PASS env vars.
	* Column names of arbitrary length are possible now (although
	  there is most likely a Solid limit for this).

Tested using
	* Linux 2.0.32+libc5.4.33
	  perl5.004_04
	  Solid 2.2(free Linux version)

	* WinNT 4.0 + SP3
	  Solid Server 2.2 for WinNT
	  Solid 2.2 development system
	  MS VC 5.0
	  perl5.004_04

The source of DBD::Solid is available from

	http://members.ping.at/wenrich/DBD-Solid.html
     or from CPAN (authors/id/TWENRICH/DBD-Solid-0.11.tar.gz)

     You will also need:
        * Perl (of course!), Version 5.003 or better
	* the most recent DBI driver module (currently V 0.92)
	* the Solid development system
	* a Solid database server

Information about the SOLID database can be found via

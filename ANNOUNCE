Hi everybody,

DBD::Solid v0.04 is ready for another try.

DBD::Solid is a perl module to access the SOLID RDBMS, one of the 
few SQL/ODBC databases engines available for Linux and for other UNIX 
and non-UNIX platforms.

The most important changes in this release are:
	* blob_read() is working now (at least with Solid v2.2).
	* experimental support for dynamic loading.
	* $sth->{TYPES} now returns numeric values. Corresponding 
	  constants can be imported from DBD::Solid::Const. 
	* Changed errorhandling.
	* Makefile.PL knows about Solid 2.2 filenames.
	* a few, but ugly bugs are fixed.

I tested this only with i486 Linux. Porting to other UNIX systems should be
easy, with VMS or NT you are at your own.

The source of DBD::Solid is available from

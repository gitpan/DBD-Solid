Friends, 

I just uploaded DBD::Solid 0.10 to CPAN. 

DBD::Solid is a driver code that enables Perl 5.003 and 5.004
to access the Solid RDBMS via the DBI module (you will need
the code for the latest release of DBI and DBD::Solid).

Tim Bunce's DBI module is *the* standard way to access a number of 
different databases from perl.

SOLID is one of the few SQL/ODBC databases engines available for 
Linux and for other UNIX and non-UNIX platforms.

New in this release (compared to 0.09):
    * added Win32 ($Config{ostype} == 'MSWin32') to Makefile.PL
    * added freebsd to Makefile.PL (thanks to Tom)
    * fixed ping() method for Solid's unix pipe connections 
      (thanks to Tom Moertel)

Tested using
	* Linux 2.0.32+libc5.4.33
	  perl5.004_04
	  Solid 2.2(free Linux version)

	* WinNT 4.0 + SP3
	  Solid Server 2.2 for WinNT
	  Solid 2.2 development system
	  MS VC 5.0
	  perl5.004_04

The source of DBD::Solid is available from

	http://members.ping.at/wenrich/DBD-Solid.html
     or from CPAN (authors/id/TWENRICH/DBD-Solid-0.10.tar.gz)

     You will also need:
        * Perl (of course!), Version 5.003 or better
	* the most recent DBI driver module (currently V 0.92)
	* the Solid development system
	* a Solid database server

Information about the SOLID database can be found via

	http://www.solid.fi/
     or http://www.solidtech.com/

Regards,

Thomas

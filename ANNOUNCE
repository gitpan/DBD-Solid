Everyone, 

I've put together a new release of DBD::Solid, a DBD module written by 
Thomas Wenrich to access the Solid Embedded Engine.

Tim Bunce's DBI module is *the* standard way to access a number of 
different databases from perl.  FYI, DBD::Solid is a driver code that enables
 Perl 5.003 and 5.004 to access the Solid RDBMS via the DBI module 
(you will need the code for the latest release of DBI and DBD::Solid).

This version contains a patch provided by Brian Slesinsky way back when which
fixes a problem on Solaris machines using time stamps.  It also has an better
script for building.

Hi everybody,

DBD::Solid is a driver module to access the SOLID RDBMS from 
the perl language using the DBI interface.

Tim Bunce's DBI module is *the* standard way to access a number of 
different databases from perl.

SOLID is one of the few SQL/ODBC databases engines available for 
Linux and for other UNIX and non-UNIX platforms.

Changes:
    Bugfixes:
	* bind_columns works immediate after the describe.
        * AutoCommit is done by the driver itself [Solid bug ???]
	* disconnect() rollbacks or commits depending 
	  on AutoCommit.
    DBI compliance fixes:
        * $dbh->{AutoCommit} is ON by default.
	* $h->{ChopBlanks} was implemented.
	* $sth->execute() returns the row count (the same value
	  as $h->rows(), so returns -1 after executing a SELECT).
	* $sth->rows() counts the rows actually fetched from the
	  database.
    Enhancements:
	* The write/only attribute $dbh->{solid_characterset} may be
	  used to activate Solid's character set translation features.
	* Makefile.PL knows about following operating systems:
		linux SCO3.2 hpux irix solaris
	* changed function names so DBD::Oracle and DBD::Solid may
	  coexist within the same static perl binary
        * Uses perl's default type of linking (when perl thinks it's
          ok to link dynamic, DBD::Solid will use dynamic linking, 
	  too)
        * Some pod documentation was added, describing DBD::Solid 
	  specific issues.
    INCOMPATIBILITIES:
    	* It's not longer possible to set the size of the buffer 
	  used to fetch LONG columns using the $sth->{blob_size} syntax.
	  You may use either the solid_blob_size attribute to prepare()
	  or the blob_read function.
        * After fetching all rows, $sth->err becomes zero instead 
	  of +100 to suppress weird messages from $h->{PrintError} 
	  at end of each fetch.
        * Still unsupported DBI attributes:
	  $dbh->ping

Tested using:
	* Linux 2.0.29+libc5.4.23
	  perl5.004
	  Solid 2.2(free Linux version)

	* SCO 3.2.4
	  SCO development system
	  perl5.003
	  Solid 2.2 development system


The source of DBD::Solid is available from

	http://members.ping.at/wenrich/DBD-Solid.html
     or from CPAN (authors/TWENRICH/DBD-Solid-0.07.tar.gz)

     You will also need:
	* the most recent DBI driver module
	* the Solid development system

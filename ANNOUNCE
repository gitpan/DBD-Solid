Friends, 

I just uploaded DBD::Solid 0.09 to CPAN. 

DBD::Solid is a driver code that enables Perl 5.003 and 5.004
to access the Solid RDBMS via the DBI module (you will need
the code for the latest release of DBI and DBD::Solid).

Tim Bunce's DBI module is *the* standard way to access a number of 
different databases from perl.

SOLID is one of the few SQL/ODBC databases engines available for 
Linux and for other UNIX and non-UNIX platforms.

New in this release (compared to 0.08):
    * added support for InactiveDestroy (as suggested by tim)
    * added ping() method.
    * added irix to Makefile.PL (and a note in the README) 
    * Autocommit relies (again) on the corresponding database
      function.

Tested using
	* Linux 2.0.29+libc5.4.38
	  perl5.004
	  Solid 2.2(free Linux version)

	* SCO 3.2.4
	  SCO development system
	  perl5.003
	  Solid 2.2 development system


The source of DBD::Solid is available from

	http://members.ping.at/wenrich/DBD-Solid.html
     or from CPAN (authors/id/TWENRICH/DBD-Solid-0.09.tar.gz)

     You will also need:
        * Perl (of course!), Version 5.003 or better
	* the most recent DBI driver module (currently V 0.90)
	* the Solid development system
	* a Solid database server

Information about the SOLID database can be found via

     or http://www.solidtech.com/

Thomas

Hi everybody,

DBD::Solid is a driver module to access the SOLID RDBMS using 
Tim Bunce's DBI interface. 

SOLID is one of the few SQL/ODBC databases engines available for 
Linux and for other UNIX and non-UNIX platforms.

Changes in this release are:
	* truncate of LONG fields is now working
	* some minor bugs are fixed
	* error handling complies to the DBI draft specification
	  ($h->err, $h->errstr and $h->state should be full functional)
	* Makefile.PL is now a bit more intelligent
	* Tested with Perl5.003_95 and DBI-0.81

Following DBI features are currently NOT supported:
	$h->{CompatMode}
	$h->{InactiveDestroy}
	$h->{ChopBlanks}
	$dbh->ping

I tested this only with i486 Linux. Porting to other UNIX systems should be
easy, with VMS or NT you are at your own.

The source of DBD::Solid is available from

	http://members.ping.at/wenrich/DBD-Solid.html
     or from CPAN (Authors/TWENRICH/DBD-Solid-0.05.tar.gz)

Priority 1:
	* verify working bind_param() function for LONG inserts.
	* switching DATE/TIME values to a useable format (i.e. seconds/1970) 
	  by setting an attribute. Having this in the DBI spec
	  would be nice.
	* $sth->state isn't working (DBI ???)
	* add new DBI features:
		$h->{CompatMode}
		$h->{InactiveDestroy}
		$h->{ChopBlanks}
		$dbh->ping
	
Priority 2: 
	* enable/disable character set conversions.
	* check row locking works and how to do locking with SOLID.
	* save memory by fetching numeric and date/time values 
	  _binary_ from solid.

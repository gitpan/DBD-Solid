Priority 1:
	* verify working bind_param() function for LONG inserts.
	* add SQLSTATE variable
	* switching DATE/TIME values to a useable format (i.e. seconds/1970) 
	  by setting an attribute. Having this in the DBI spec
	  would be nice.

Priority 2: 
	* check row locking works and how to do locking with SOLID.
	* save memory by fetching numeric and date/time values 
	  _binary_ from solid.
